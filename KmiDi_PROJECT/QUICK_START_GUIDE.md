## 🎛️ The Three Sliders (Optional)

You don't need to use these, but they help:

1. **Motivation** (Left to Right)
   - Left = Calm
   - Right = Energetic

2. **Chaos** (Left to Right)
   - Left = Predictable
   - Right = Wild

3. **Vulnerability** (Left to Right)
   - Left = Guarded
   - Right = Emotional

**Tip:** Start with them in the middle, then move them around to see what happens!
