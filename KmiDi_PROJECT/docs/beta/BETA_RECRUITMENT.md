# Beta Tester Recruitment Plan for KmiDi Project

This document outlines the strategy for recruiting beta testers for the KmiDi Music Generation application. The goal is to gather diverse feedback from relevant user groups to ensure the application meets real-world needs and performs reliably.

## 1. Recruitment Goal

Recruit 5-10 beta testers, including:
*   Therapists/music therapists
*   Musicians (composers, producers, instrumentalists)
*   Music educators

## 2. Recruitment Channels

We will utilize the following channels to reach potential beta testers:

*   **Professional Networks**: Reach out to contacts in music therapy, education, and professional music communities.
*   **Online Forums & Communities**: Post in relevant online forums, subreddits (e.g., r/musictheory, r/wearethemusicmakers), and music production communities.
*   **Social Media**: Leverage Twitter, LinkedIn, and specialized music-related groups to announce the beta program.
*   **Direct Outreach**: Personally invite individuals who have expressed interest in AI-assisted music creation or music therapy tools.

## 3. Application Process

We will create a simple online application form to collect essential information from prospective testers. The form will include:

*   **Contact Information**: Name, email, preferred communication method.
*   **Background**: Profession (therapist, musician, educator, etc.), years of experience.
*   **Technical Setup**: Operating system, DAW used (if any), MIDI hardware availability.
*   **Motivation**: Why they are interested in KmiDi and what they hope to achieve.
*   **Time Commitment**: Expected availability for testing and providing feedback.
