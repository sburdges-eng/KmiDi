      "reasoning": "The groove_predictor model is already trained and has a relatively complex architecture with 6 LSTM layers. Given the task of predicting micro-timing offsets, which requires capturing temporal dependencies, a moderate learning rate is chosen to ensure stable convergence. The Lakh MIDI dataset is suitable for this task, and the batch size is set to 64 to balance between memory usage and convergence speed on the available ARM processor with MPS acceleration.",

  "compute_recommendations": "Utilize the MPS acceleration on the ARM processor to speed up training. Ensure that the batch size and model complexity are balanced to fit within the memory constraints of the available hardware. Consider running training sessions during off-peak hours to maximize resource availability."
