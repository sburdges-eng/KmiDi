      "suggested_lr": 0.001,
      "reasoning": "The dynamics_engine model is already trained, but further fine-tuning can enhance its performance. Given the MLP architecture and the task of mapping expression parameters, a moderate number of epochs and a batch size of 64 are optimal for balancing training time and convergence. A learning rate of 0.001 is suggested to ensure stable updates without overshooting the optimal weights.",

  "overall_strategy": "The primary focus is on fine-tuning the dynamics_engine model to improve its mapping accuracy. Given the model's existing trained state, the strategy involves refining its performance through targeted adjustments in hyperparameters and leveraging data augmentation to enhance generalization.",
  "compute_recommendations": "Utilize the MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) on the Darwin platform to accelerate training. This will take advantage of the ARM processor's capabilities and optimize the training process. Ensure that the batch size is compatible with the available memory to maximize throughput without causing memory overflow."
