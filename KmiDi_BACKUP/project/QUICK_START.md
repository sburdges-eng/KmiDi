# KmiDi Quick Start Guide
## Get Making Music in 5 Minutes!

### Step 1: Choose Your Platform

**Desktop App** (Best for regular use)
- Download from kmidi.app
- Install and open
- Start creating!

**Web App** (No installation)
- Go to kmidi.app in your browser
- Click "Start Creating"
- No download needed!

### Step 2: Describe How You Feel

In the text box, write your emotion. Examples:

✅ **Good Examples:**
- "I feel peaceful and calm, like a quiet morning"
- "I'm excited and energetic, ready to celebrate"
- "I feel sad but hopeful, like things will get better"

❌ **Less Helpful:**
- "sad" (too simple)
- "music" (not an emotion)

**Tip**: Be specific! Add details about how intense the feeling is or what situation it relates to.

### Step 3: Click "Generate Music"

That's it! KmiDi will create music that matches your emotion.

Wait 10-30 seconds while it works...

### Step 4: Listen

Click the **Play** button to hear your music.

**Don't like it?**
- Click "Generate" again for a new version
- Adjust the sliders (Motivation, Chaos, Vulnerability)
- Try a different description

### Step 5: Save Your Work

Click **Save** to keep your project, or **Export** to download the music file.

## The Three Sliders (Optional)

You don't need to use these, but they help fine-tune:

**Motivation** (Energy)
- Low = Calm, peaceful
- High = Energetic, intense

**Chaos** (Predictability)  
- Low = Stable, predictable
- High = Wild, unpredictable

**Vulnerability** (Openness)
- Low = Guarded, protected
- High = Open, raw

**Start with them in the middle** - you can always adjust later!

## Common First-Time Questions

**Q: What if I don't like the music?**  
A: Generate again! Each time is different. Or try describing your emotion differently.

**Q: Do I need music software?**  
A: No! KmiDi works on its own. Music software is only needed if you want to use the plugins.

**Q: Can I edit the music?**  
A: Yes! Export as MIDI and open in any music program, or use KmiDi's built-in editor.

**Q: How long should my description be?**  
A: A sentence or two is perfect. Be specific but don't overthink it!
