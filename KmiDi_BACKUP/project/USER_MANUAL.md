## Creating Your First Song

Let's walk through creating your very first song step by step.

### A Simple Example: "A Song About Missing Someone"

**Step 1: Open KmiDi**
- Open the Desktop App, Web App, or Mobile App

**Step 2: Describe Your Feeling**
- Type: "I'm missing someone I love. It's sad but also beautiful, like remembering good times."

**Step 3: Set Your Mood**
- **Motivation**: Set to medium (about 50%)
- **Chaos**: Set to low (about 20%) - we want it calm
- **Vulnerability**: Set to high (about 80%) - we want it emotional

**Step 4: Generate**
- Click "Generate Music"
- Wait 10-30 seconds

**Step 5: Listen**
- Click play
- Does it match what you're feeling?
- If not, try adjusting the sliders and generating again

**Step 6: Save**
- Click "Save"
- Name it "Missing You"
- Save it!

**Congratulations!** You've created your first song with KmiDi!

### Tips for Better Results

- **Be specific**: "I'm feeling sad" is okay, but "I'm feeling sad because I'm alone on a rainy day" is better
- **Use emotions, not instruments**: Don't say "I want a piano" - say "I want something gentle and intimate"
- **Experiment**: Try different combinations of settings
- **Don't give up**: If the first result isn't perfect, try again with different words
