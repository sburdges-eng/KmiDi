      "suggested_lr": 0.001,
      "reasoning": "The LSTM architecture is well-suited for sequence generation tasks like melodic sequence generation. Given that the model is already trained, we can focus on fine-tuning. The Lakh MIDI dataset is large, so a moderate batch size of 64 balances memory usage and training speed. A learning rate of 0.001 is typical for LSTMs and should allow for stable convergence without overshooting.",

  "overall_strategy": "Focus on fine-tuning the melody_transformer model using the Lakh MIDI dataset. Leverage the existing trained state to improve the model's ability to generate coherent melodic sequences. Prioritize this model due to its direct applicability to the task and the availability of a suitable dataset.",
  "compute_recommendations": "Utilize the MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) on the Darwin platform to accelerate training. This will help in efficiently handling the LSTM computations. Ensure that the batch size and learning rate are optimized for the ARM processor to maximize throughput while maintaining model accuracy."
