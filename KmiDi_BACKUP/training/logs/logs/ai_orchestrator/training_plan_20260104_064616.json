      "suggested_epochs": 30,
      "suggested_batch_size": 16,
      "suggested_lr": 0.001,
      "reasoning": "The emotion_recognizer model is already trained, suggesting that further fine-tuning is required rather than full retraining. Given the CNN architecture and the task of audio emotion classification, a moderate number of epochs will allow for sufficient fine-tuning without overfitting. The batch size of 16 balances memory usage and training speed, especially considering the ARM processor. A learning rate of 0.001 is typical for fine-tuning CNNs, allowing for gradual updates to the model weights.",

  ],
  "overall_strategy": "Focus on fine-tuning the emotion_recognizer model to improve its performance on the m4singer dataset. Prioritize using data augmentation techniques to increase the robustness of the model against variations in audio input. Evaluate using both accuracy and F1-score to ensure balanced performance across emotion classes.",
  "compute_recommendations": "Utilize the MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) on the Darwin platform to accelerate training. This will leverage the GPU capabilities available on the ARM processor, optimizing training speed and efficiency. Ensure that the batch size and data loading are optimized to fully utilize the available compute resources without causing memory bottlenecks."
