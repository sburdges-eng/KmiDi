      "suggested_batch_size": 64,
      "suggested_lr": 0.001,
      "reasoning": "The harmony_predictor model is already trained and has a relatively simple architecture (MLP with 3 layers). Given the task of chord progression prediction, which is less complex than tasks like audio generation, a moderate number of epochs should suffice. The batch size of 64 balances memory usage and convergence speed on the available ARM processor with MPS support. A learning rate of 0.001 is typical for MLPs and should provide stable learning.",

  "overall_strategy": "Given the simplicity of the MLP architecture and the task, focus on efficient training using the available MPS support on the ARM processor. Prioritize the harmony_predictor model as it is already trained and may benefit from fine-tuning or additional training to improve performance.",
  "compute_recommendations": "Utilize the MPS support on the ARM processor to accelerate training. Ensure that the batch size and learning rate are optimized for the available memory and processing power. Consider running training sessions during low-usage periods to maximize resource availability."
